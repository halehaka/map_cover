# Welecome to Tal Kraicer's Reserach Project :)

It is an image segmantation projects on Landcover.ai (Download - https://landcover.ai.linuxpolska.com/ (v1)) and FloodNET (https://technionmail-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/talkraicer_campus_technion_ac_il/Eix_sp97lGJOoQSvnat6vA0BAZV1Unk39_mnPcJftSraaA?e=UuV9Aa - also contains some other photos not in use)

You can Download the data from the above link.

The requirements can be found in requirements.txt. NVIDIA-SMI 510.85.02    Driver Version: 510.85.02    CUDA Version: 11.6.

You can find my final code files in Final_Code Directory.

In order to train new model visit train.py file and follow the instructions tagged in TODO. Please read the instructions carefully.
Same goes for testing, just follow the instructions in test.py. You can either select one of the models I've uploaded or train a new one and choose it.

The models I've uploaded: LandCover-FloodNET-retrained-twice: trained on both datasets, v1-FloodNET-retrained-twice: trained on FloodNET and v7-LandCover-retrained-twice: trained on LandCover.

The folder Israel Datasets contains some other images, and another dataset - FloodNET, which the model was tested and trained on.

In the older versions and older models you can find older results I've reached, documented on the Results Documentation.txt file.

For some visualizitaion, you're welecome to explore to ./exmaples directory which contains predictions of each of the models on each of the datsets.

Thank You.
